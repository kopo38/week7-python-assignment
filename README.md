Iris Dataset Analysis
Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for classification problems. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, basic statistical computations, and visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. The code is written in Python using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Features

Data Loading and Exploration: Loads the Iris dataset, displays initial rows, checks data types, and handles missing values (if any).
Basic Data Analysis: Computes descriptive statistics and group means by species to identify patterns.
Visualizations: Creates four types of plots:
Line plot of cumulative mean sepal length
Bar plot of average petal length by species
Histogram of sepal width distribution
Scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length


Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for file loading and analysis steps.
Output: Saves visualizations to a file (iris_visualizations.png).

Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Required Python packages:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
numpy



You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy

Usage

Clone or Download: Obtain the project files, including iris_analysis.py.
Run the Script: Execute the main Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations:python iris_analysis.py


View Outputs:
Console output will display dataset information, statistics, group means, and analysis insights.
Visualizations will be saved as iris_visualizations.png in the project directory.



File Structure

iris_analysis.py: Main Python script containing the analysis code.
iris_visualizations.png: Output file containing the generated plots (created after running the script).
README.md: This file, providing project documentation.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is sourced from scikit-learn's load_iris() function. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
Insights

Different iris species show distinct measurements in sepal and petal dimensions.
Virginica tends to have the largest measurements on average.
Setosa typically has the smallest measurements, especially in petal length.
The scatter plot reveals clear separation between species based on sepal and petal lengths.

Notes

The Iris dataset is typically clean, so missing value handling is included but rarely needed.
Visualizations are customized with titles, labels, and legends for clarity.
Seaborn is used for enhanced visual styling.
